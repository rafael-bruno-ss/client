## Running

You will need an emulator installed and configured or your Android/iOS device connected on your computer. Then, run `npm run android` or `npm run ios`


## The problem

I'm trying to implement a simple tabview, but there's a problem in my routes that I can't figure it out. That's the error message: `Error: Uncaught (in promise): Error: Cannot match any routes. URL Segment: 'resources'`

I've already tried to implement different solutions that I found on the internet, but none was successful.
